# Online Judge System

Written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and powered by [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), this system aims to conduct programmming contests. 
It can run code, and test them with pre-constructed data. Submitted code will be run with a time limit restriction. 
The output of the code will be captured by the system, and compared with the standard output. The system returns the following results-
- AC : Accepted
- WA : Wrong Answer
- TLE : Time Limit Exceeded
- RTE : Run Time Error
